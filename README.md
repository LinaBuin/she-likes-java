### I like Java - a little bit :)

// Animal tiger = new Tiger(); Animal is ref. type with 'go' method inside
/// only from Animal we can take "go"
//tiger.go(); - calling to action - 'go'
//
// when working on code, check structure for methods inherited
// if you omplement interface, you must override. 'Public void 'is needed to call behaviour

((Ship) ship).swim() its casting to ship
